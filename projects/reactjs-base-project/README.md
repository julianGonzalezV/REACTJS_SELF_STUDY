# reactjs-base-project
base project for starting a new react js application

Install current proyect:
1) yarn install for dependencies download
2) yarn start for uplaoad the aplication
3) Remember you need the micro-services projects runing too (by the time of this writing I used scala microServices and I was thinking in some other like jav8 with spring-boot and other variaty like clojure microService , in order to demonstrate the benefits of implementing services oriented architecture (no limit the backend languagues, one of them could be close or shut down and the others working, then the bunch of code that dont work is only the one is using that microservice) )
